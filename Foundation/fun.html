                        <p>
                            &nbsp;Hey there, I'm John, and I am 21 years young as of this web page's most recent update. Though I currently study computer science in Minnesota, I've actually lived in five different states before arriving here! </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;My parents both graduated from the Air Force Academy, so I spent a lot of my early life traveling to a new state every three to four years. As I got older, my parents' assignments got less frequent, and thus I have resided in Colorado since I was ten years old.               
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, I call Colorado home because it has been the place I've grown up the longest and made my best memories while going through elementary, middle, and high school. 
                        </p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my favorite activites involve hiking, running, reading, and watching classic films. I've been running since the 8th grade, and racing competively has been something I've taken seriously, as I now specializein the 800m on the Division 1 program here at St. Thomas. I've made some of my best friends while training, and being in this sport is something I'm immensely proud of! You can find some of the results from my races <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/7743117/St_Thomas/John__Morrison.html" target="_blank"> here. </a>

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the 2nd of four siblings, and have an awesome, adorable cat named Lucy as well. My older brother graduated from St. John's University in Collegeville, my sister is a freshman at the University of Colorado Boulder, and my younger brother is a junior in high school. Despite my older brother and I going to rival schools, we actually have no family in Minnesota, and I found St. Thomas while my brother was on recruiting visits for soccer!

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I've really gotten back into reading, and am currently working on finishing the Harry Potter series. My favorite thus far has to be the 5th book: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I've also read some of Philip K. Dick's work, as I am a big fan of the <i>Blade Runner</i> film series.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Blade Runner </i> franchise is great in my opinion, but my favorite movies really stem from Wes Anderson. <i>Asteroid City</i>, his most recent film, has got to be my favorite, though I've seen a handful of his works. The way he directs and writes such unique scripts is something I really get a kick of. The movies keep you drawn in, but also keep it comedic in a way that I haven't seen from any other director. 
                        </p>
